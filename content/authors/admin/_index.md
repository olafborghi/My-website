I am a psychology student currently in the first year of my masters degree. I am particularly interested in social neuroscience and methods research. As a student and as a student research assistent I am lucky to get the opportunity to gain insights in both fields. 

At the weekend I contribute to a project investigating the evolutionary roots of the social brain as a MRI operator in canine and human fMRI data collection. During the week I help out with organizational tasks and contribute to undergraduate lectures in the field of methods, by providing tutorials to students in the course of an introductory lecture to statistics and quantitative methods.

I am always super eager to learn and explore new things both within and outside my field of study!
